# Tools
General Tools I use frequenly


l8n1ght.bat > Enter time in minutes to initialize a automatic shutdown countdown

RunJava.bat > Lazy with manually compiling java files so i made a script to do it for me +Text files are included+ "Java.txt and ascii.txt"

Autoindent.vbs > I was tired of manually indenting my code when I made a mistake so i created this. Not very useful for python. Shortcut to indent (Ctrl + ])

Alfa final.py > Used as a character shifter. Only shifts twice with current version. Caesar Cypher. Will extend functionality to accept a shift digit.
